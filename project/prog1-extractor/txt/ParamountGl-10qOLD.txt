Basis of Presentation—The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the more detailed financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Discontinued Operations—Simon & Schuster is presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented (see Note 2).

Use of Estimates—The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily

apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Net Earnings (Loss) per Common Share—Basic net earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) is based upon net earnings (loss) available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Net earnings (loss) available to common stockholders is calculated as net earnings (loss) from continuing operations or net earnings (loss), as applicable, adjusted to include a reduction for dividends recorded during the applicable period on our 5.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock”).

Weighted average shares for diluted EPS reflects the effect of the assumed exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted share units (“RSUs”) or performance share units (“PSUs”) only in the periods in which such effect would have been dilutive. Diluted EPS also reflects the effect of the assumed conversion of preferred stock, if dilutive, which includes the issuance of common shares in the weighted average number of shares and excludes the above-mentioned preferred stock dividend adjustment to net earnings (loss) available to common stockholders.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, all of our stock options and RSUs, which totaled 19 million, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would have been antidilutive since we reported a net loss. Stock options and RSUs totaling 18 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 14 million and 10 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, were excluded from the calculations of diluted EPS because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. Also excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS for each period was the effect of the assumed conversion of 10 million shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of common stock because the impact would have been antidilutive. The table below presents a reconciliation of weighted average shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS.

Additionally, because the impact of the assumed conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock would have been antidilutive, net earnings (loss) from continuing operations and net earnings (loss) used in our calculations of diluted EPS for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 include a reduction for the preferred stock dividends recorded during each period.

Simon & Schuster
On October 30, 2023, we completed the sale of Simon & Schuster to affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. for $1.62 billion. As a result, we will recognize a gain in the fourth quarter of 2023, which we estimate will be approximately $700 million.

In September 2022, in connection with our funding commitments under our streaming joint venture with Comcast Corporation, SkyShowtime, we made a noncash contribution of certain assets of Paramount+ in the Nordics to the joint venture, which resulted in a gain of $41 million. This gain is included in “Gain on dispositions” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Gain on dispositions for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 also includes gains on sales totaling $15 million, comprised of a gain from the sale of international intangible assets and a working capital adjustment to the gain from the fourth quarter 2021 sale of CBS Studio Center.

Programming Charges
During the first half of 2023, in connection with the integration of Showtime into Paramount+ across both streaming and linear platforms, we performed a comprehensive strategic review of the combined content portfolio of Showtime and Paramount+. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2023, we commenced a review of our international content portfolio in connection with initiatives to rationalize and right-size our international operations to align with our streaming strategy, and close or globalize certain of our international channels. As a result, we changed the strategy for certain content, which led to content being removed from our platforms or abandoned, the write-off of development costs, distribution changes, and termination of programming agreements. Accordingly, during the first half of 2023 we recorded programming charges on the Consolidated Statement of Operations relating to these actions. These charges, which totaled $2.37 billion, were comprised of $1.97 billion for the impairment of content to its estimated fair value, as well as $402 million for development cost write-offs and contract termination costs. For content that was removed from our platforms or abandoned, the estimated fair value was determined using assumptions for secondary market licensing revenues, if any.
4) RELATED PARTIES
National Amusements, Inc.
National Amusements, Inc. (“NAI”) is the controlling stockholder of the Company. At September 30, 2023, NAI directly or indirectly owned approximately 77.4% of our voting Class A Common Stock and approximately 9.8% of our Class A Common Stock and non-voting Class B Common Stock on a combined basis. NAI is controlled by the Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Part B General Trust (the “General Trust”), which owns 80% of the voting interest of NAI and acts by majority vote of seven voting trustees (subject to certain exceptions), including with respect to the NAI shares held by the General Trust. Shari E. Redstone, Chairperson, CEO and President of NAI and non-executive Chair of our Board of Directors, is one of the seven voting trustees for the General Trust and is one of two voting trustees who are beneficiaries of the General Trust. No member of our management or other member of our Board of Directors is a trustee of the General Trust.

Total Revenues	$	7,133 			$	6,916 			$	22,014 			$	22,023 	
Receivables
Reserves for accounts receivable reflect our expected credit losses based on historical experience as well as current and expected economic conditions. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our allowance for credit losses was $99 million and $111 million, respectively.

Included in “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are noncurrent receivables of $1.42 billion and $1.61 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Noncurrent receivables primarily relate to revenues recognized under long-term content licensing arrangements. Revenues from the licensing of content are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition, while the related cash is generally collected over the term of the license period.

Contract Liabilities
Contract liabilities are included within “Deferred revenues” and “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were $0.9 billion and $1.06 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We recognized revenues of $0.8 billion for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 that were included in the opening balance of deferred revenues for the respective year.

Unrecognized Revenues Under Contract
At September 30, 2023, unrecognized revenues attributable to unsatisfied performance obligations under our long-term contracts were approximately $8 billion, of which $1 billion is expected to be recognized during the remainder of 2023, $3 billion in 2024, $2 billion in 2025, and $2 billion thereafter. These amounts only include contracts subject to a guaranteed fixed amount or the guaranteed minimum under variable contracts, primarily consisting of television and film licensing contracts and affiliate agreements that are subject to a fixed or guaranteed minimum fee. Such amounts change on a regular basis as we renew existing agreements or enter into new agreements. In addition, the timing of satisfying certain of the performance obligations under these long-term contracts is uncertain and, therefore, is also subject to change. Unrecognized revenues under contracts disclosed above do not include (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less, mainly consisting of advertising contracts, (ii) contracts for which variable consideration is determined based on the customer’s subsequent sale or usage, mainly consisting of affiliate agreements and (iii) long-term licensing agreements for multiple programs for which variable consideration is determined based on the value of the programs delivered to the customer and our right to invoice corresponds with the value delivered.

Performance Obligations Satisfied in Previous Periods
Under certain licensing arrangements, the amount and timing of our revenue recognition is determined based on our licensees’ subsequent sale to its end customers. As a result, under such arrangements we often satisfy our performance obligation of delivery of our content in advance of revenue recognition. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we recognized revenues of $0.1 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively, and for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we recognized revenues of $0.3 billion, from arrangements for the licensing of our content, including from distributors of transactional video-on-demand and electronic sell-through services and other licensing arrangements, as well as from the theatrical distribution of our films, for which our performance obligation was satisfied in a prior period.

In September 2023, we repaid our $139 million of 7.875% debentures upon maturity. In addition, on November 1, 2023, we repaid our $35 million of 7.125% senior notes upon maturity.

On November 2, 2023, we announced the commencement of cash tender offers for up to $1.0 billion combined aggregate purchase price of certain of our outstanding senior notes due between 2025 and 2028.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we redeemed $2.39 billion of senior notes, prior to maturity, for an aggregate redemption price of $2.49 billion. Also in 2022, we redeemed $520 million of 5.875% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 at par. These redemptions resulted in a total pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $120 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we also issued $1.00 billion of 6.375% junior subordinated debentures due 2062.

Commercial Paper
At both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings.

Credit Facility
During the first quarter of 2023, we amended and extended our $3.50 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), which now matures in January 2027 (the “2023 Amendment”). The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper borrowings, if any. We may, at our option, also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at the time of each borrowing and are generally based on either the prime rate in the U.S. or an applicable benchmark rate plus a margin (based on our senior unsecured debt rating), depending on the type and tenor of the loans entered into. Under the 2023 Amendment, we replaced LIBOR as the benchmark rate for loans denominated in U.S. dollars with Term SOFR. The benchmark rate for loans denominated in euros, sterling and yen is based on EURIBOR, SONIA and TIBOR, respectively. The Credit Facility was also amended to include a provision that the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the amended credit agreement) of Paramount will be an event of default that would give the lenders the right to accelerate any outstanding loans and terminate their commitments. At September 30, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the availability under the Credit Facility was $3.50 billion.

The Credit Facility has one principal financial covenant which sets a maximum Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (“Leverage Ratio”) at the end of each quarter, which prior to the 2023 Amendment was 4.5x. Under the 2023 Amendment, the maximum Leverage Ratio was increased to 5.75x for each quarter through and including the quarter ending September 30, 2024, and will then decrease to 5.5x for the quarters ending December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, with decreases of 0.25x for each subsequent quarter until it reaches 4.5x for the quarter ending March 31, 2026. The Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of our Consolidated Indebtedness, net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at the end of a quarter, to our Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the amended credit agreement) for the trailing twelve-month period. Under the 2023 Amendment, the definition of the Leverage Ratio was also modified to set the maximum amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents that can be netted against Consolidated Indebtedness to $1.50 billion for quarters ending on or after September 30, 2024. In addition, under the 2023 Amendment, Simon & Schuster was treated as a continuing operation for the purposes of calculating Consolidated EBITDA until its disposition in October 2023. We met the covenant as of September 30, 2023.

Other Bank Borrowings
At September 30, 2023, we had no outstanding bank borrowings under Miramax’s $50 million credit facility, which matures in November 2024. This facility replaced the previous $300 million credit facility that matured in April 2023. At December 31, 2022, we had $55 million of bank borrowings under the previous facility with a weighted average interest rate of 7.09%.
7) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The carrying value of our financial instruments approximates fair value, except for notes and debentures. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our outstanding notes and debentures was $15.66 billion and $15.78 billion, respectively, and the fair value, which is determined based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy) was $13.0 billion and $13.9 billion, respectively.

Investments
In April 2023, our ownership of Viacom18 was diluted from 49% to 13% following investment by other parties. Accordingly, we no longer account for it under the equity method. The difference between the carrying value of our 49% interest and the fair value of our 13% interest, as indicated by the additional investments, resulted in a noncash gain of $168 million during the second quarter of 2023.

In September 2022, we sold a 37.5% interest in The CW to Nexstar Media Inc. and received a noncash distribution of $139 million, comprised of certain licensing receivables earned by The CW prior to the sale. This transaction, which reduced our ownership in The CW to 12.5%, resulted in a loss of $4 million, which principally consisted of transaction costs. This loss, along with an impairment of an investment of $5 million, is recorded in “Gain (loss) from investments” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The carrying value of our investments without a readily determinable fair value for which we have no significant influence, including Viacom18 subsequent to the dilution of our investment, was $592 million and $70 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. These investments are included in “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Foreign Exchange Contracts
We use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, we do not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.

Foreign exchange forward contracts have principally been used to hedge projected cash flows, in currencies such as the British pound, the euro, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar, generally for periods up to 24 months. We designate foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions as cash flow hedges. Additionally, we enter into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows.

At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the notional amount of all foreign exchange contracts was $2.62 billion and $3.06 billion, respectively. At September 30, 2023, $2.14 billion related to future production costs and $477 million related to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows. At December 31, 2022, $2.40 billion related to future production costs and $655 million related to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows.

Fair Value Measurements
The table below presents our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. These assets and liabilities have been categorized according to the three-level fair value hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. Level 1 is based on publicly quoted prices for the asset or liability in active markets. Level 2 is based on inputs that are observable other than quoted market prices in active markets, such as quoted prices for the asset or liability in inactive markets or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities. Level 3 is based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. All of our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis use level 2 inputs. The fair value of foreign currency hedges is determined based on the present value of future cash flows using observable inputs including foreign currency exchange rates. The fair value of deferred compensation liabilities is determined based on the fair value of the investments elected by employees.

The estimated fair value of our impaired content was determined using level 3 inputs. See Note 3.

8) VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
In the normal course of business, we enter into joint ventures or make investments with business partners that support our underlying business strategy and provide us the ability to enter new markets to expand the reach of our brands, develop new programming and/or distribute our existing content. In certain instances, an entity in which we make an investment may qualify as a variable interest entity (“VIE”). In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we assess whether we have the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the VIE, and have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

10) INCOME TAXES
The provision for/benefit from income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign taxes on earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $40 million, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of $436 million, reflecting effective income tax rates of 10.6% and 30.4%, respectively. Included in the third quarter of 2023 is a net discrete tax benefit of $33 million, primarily reflecting the benefit from guidance issued during the quarter by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) that resulted in additional foreign taxes from 2022 being eligible for a foreign tax credit, and amounts realized in connection with the filing of our tax returns in certain international jurisdictions. These items, together with a tax provision of $3 million on other corporate matters, decreased our effective income tax rate by 8.5 percentage points. The tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of a tax benefit of $582 million on programming charges of $2.37 billion. This item, together with a net discrete tax benefit of $67 million, which principally includes the $33 million discrete tax benefit for the quarter discussed above and the resolution of an income tax matter in a foreign jurisdiction, as well as a net tax provision of $49 million on other items identified as affecting the comparability of our results during the period (which include a gain from an investment and restructuring charges and other corporate matters), increased our effective income tax rate by 10.2 percentage points.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $101 million and $264 million, reflecting effective income tax rates of 31.3% and 20.1%, respectively. Included in the provision for income taxes for the third quarter of 2022 is a net discrete tax provision of $9 million, which primarily reflects discrete tax provisions realized in connection with the filing of our tax returns in certain international jurisdictions and from the transfer of subsidiaries in connection with a reorganization of our international operations. These items, together with a net tax benefit of $29 million on other items identified as affecting the comparability of our results during the period (which include charges for restructuring and other corporate matters, and a gain on a disposition) increased our effective income tax rate by 5.0 percentage points. The tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 included a net discrete tax benefit of $72 million primarily resulting from the transfer of intangible assets between our subsidiaries in connection with a reorganization of our international operations. This item, together with a net tax benefit of $77 million on other items identified as affecting the comparability of our results during the nine-month period (which include charges for restructuring and other corporate matters, a loss on extinguishment of debt, and gains on dispositions) decreased our effective income tax rate by 4.8 percentage points.

The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns with the IRS and various state and local and foreign jurisdictions. For periods prior to the merger of Viacom Inc. (“Viacom”) with and into CBS Corporation (“CBS”) (the “Merger”), Viacom and CBS filed separate tax returns. For CBS, we are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2017 and 2018 tax years. For Viacom, we are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2016 through 2019 tax years. For tax returns filed as a merged company, we are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2019 tax year. Various tax years are also currently under examination by state and local and foreign tax authorities. With respect to open tax years in all jurisdictions, we currently do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the reserve for uncertain tax positions will significantly change within the next 12 months; however, it is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution of any particular tax matter and events could cause our current expectation to change in the future.

These transactions are recorded at market value as if the sales were to third parties and are eliminated in consolidation. For content that is licensed between segments, content costs are allocated across segments based on the relative value of the distribution windows within each segment. Accordingly, no intersegment licensing revenues or profits are recorded by the licensor segment.

We present operating income excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and other corporate matters, programming charges and gain on dispositions, each where applicable (“Adjusted OIBDA”), as the primary measure of profit and loss for our operating segments in accordance with FASB guidance for segment reporting since it is the primary method used by our management.

CBS Television City
In connection with the sale of the CBS Television City property and sound stage operation (“CBS Television City”) in 2019, we guaranteed a specified level of cash flows to be generated by the business during the first five years following the completion of the sale. Included in “Other current liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2023 is a liability totaling $26 million, reflecting the present value of the remaining estimated amount payable under the guarantee obligation.

Lease Guarantees
We have certain indemnification obligations with respect to leases primarily associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players Inc. These lease commitments totaled $11 million at September 30, 2023, and are presented within “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of lease commitments varies over time depending on the expiration or termination of individual underlying leases, or the related indemnification obligation, and foreign exchange rates, among other things. We may also have exposure for certain other expenses related to the leases, such as property taxes and common area maintenance. We believe our accrual is sufficient to meet any future obligations based on our consideration of available financial information, the lessees’ historical performance in meeting their lease obligations and the underlying economic factors impacting the lessees’ business models.

Other
In the course of our business, we both provide and receive indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, we may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. We record a liability for our indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable and reasonably estimable.

Legal Matters
General
On an ongoing basis, we vigorously defend ourselves in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and respond to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, “Litigation”). Litigation may be brought against us without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the following matters are not likely, in the aggregate, to result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Stockholder Matters
Litigation Relating to the Merger
Beginning in February 2020, three purported CBS stockholders filed separate derivative and/or putative class action lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Chancery Court”). In March 2020, the Delaware Chancery Court consolidated the three lawsuits and appointed Bucks County Employees Retirement Fund and International Union of Operating Engineers of Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware as co-lead plaintiffs for the consolidated action captioned In re CBS Corporation Stockholder Class Action and Derivative Litigation (the “CBS Litigation”). In April 2020, the lead plaintiffs filed a Verified Consolidated Class Action and Derivative Complaint (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”) against Shari E. Redstone, National Amusements, Inc., Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Trust, additional members of the CBS Board of

Directors (including Candace K. Beinecke, Barbara M. Byrne, Gary L. Countryman, Linda M. Griego, Robert N. Klieger, Martha L. Minow, Susan Schuman, Frederick O. Terrell and Strauss Zelnick), former CBS President and Acting Chief Executive Officer Joseph Ianniello and the Company as nominal defendant. The Complaint alleged breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with the negotiation and approval of an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 13, 2019, between CBS and Viacom (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”). The Complaint also alleged waste and unjust enrichment in connection with certain aspects of Mr. Ianniello’s compensation awards. The Complaint sought unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. In December 2022, the Delaware Chancery Court dismissed the fiduciary duty claim against Mr. Klieger.

In May 2023, the parties to the CBS Litigation entered into a settlement agreement that provided for, among other things, the final dismissal of the CBS Litigation in exchange for a settlement payment to the Company in the amount of $167.5 million, less administrative costs and plaintiffs’ counsels’ fees and expenses. In September 2023, the Delaware Chancery Court approved the settlement and dismissed the CBS Litigation with prejudice. In October 2023, the Company received the settlement payment in the amount of $120 million, which reflects the settlement of $167.5 million after a deduction was made for administrative costs and plaintiffs’ counsels’ fees and expenses, and accordingly, we will recognize a gain of $120 million during the fourth quarter of 2023.

Beginning in November 2019, four purported Viacom stockholders filed separate putative class action lawsuits in the Delaware Chancery Court. In January 2020, the Delaware Chancery Court consolidated the four lawsuits. In February 2020, the Delaware Chancery Court appointed California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“CalPERS”) as lead plaintiff for the consolidated action. Subsequently, in February 2020, CalPERS, together with Park Employees’ and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago and Louis M. Wilen, filed a First Amended Verified Class Action Complaint (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”) against NAI, NAI Entertainment Holdings LLC, Shari E. Redstone, the members of the special transaction committee of the Viacom Board of Directors (comprised of Thomas J. May, Judith A. McHale, Ronald L. Nelson and Nicole Seligman) and our President and Chief Executive Officer and director, Robert M. Bakish (as used in this paragraph, the “Viacom Litigation”). The Complaint alleged breaches of fiduciary duties to Viacom stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Merger Agreement. The Complaint sought unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. In December 2020, the Delaware Chancery Court dismissed the claims against Mr. Bakish, while allowing the claims against the remaining defendants to proceed.

In March 2023, the parties to the Viacom Litigation entered into a settlement agreement that provided for, among other things, the final dismissal of the Viacom Litigation in exchange for a settlement payment in the amount of $122.5 million, which has been fully paid. In July 2023, the Delaware Chancery Court granted approval of the settlement and dismissed the Viacom Litigation with prejudice.

Litigation Related to Stock Offerings
In August 2021, Camelot Event Driven Fund filed a putative securities class action lawsuit in New York Supreme Court, County of New York, and in November 2021, an amended complaint was filed that, among other changes, added an additional named plaintiff (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”). The Complaint is purportedly on behalf of investors who purchased shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock and 5.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to public securities offerings completed in March 2021, and was filed against the Company, certain senior executives, members of our Board of Directors, and the underwriters involved in the offerings. The Complaint asserts violations of federal securities law and alleges that the offering documents contained material misstatements and omissions, including through an alleged failure to adequately disclose certain total return swap transactions involving Archegos Capital Management referenced to our securities and related alleged risks to the Company’s stock price. In December 2021, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation seeking the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the outside director defendants from the lawsuit, which the Court

subsequently ordered. On the same date, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit, which were heard in January 2023. In February 2023, the Court dismissed all claims against the Company while allowing the claims against the underwriters to proceed. The plaintiffs and underwriter defendants have appealed the ruling.

Litigation Related to Television Station Owners
In September 2019, the Company was added as a defendant in a multi-district putative class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The lawsuit was filed by parties that claim to have purchased broadcast television spot advertising beginning about January 2014 on television stations owned by one or more of the defendant television station owners and alleges the sharing of allegedly competitively sensitive information among such television stations in alleged violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The action, which names the Company among fourteen total defendants, seeks monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, costs and interest as well as injunctions against the allegedly unlawful conduct. We reached an agreement with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit. The settlement, which includes no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Company, is subject to Court approval. In August 2023, the Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement.

Claims Related to Former Businesses
Asbestos
We are a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. We are typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of our products is the basis of a claim. Claims against us in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines and electrical equipment.

Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. We do not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of September 30, 2023, we had pending approximately 20,670 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 21,580 as of December 31, 2022. During the third quarter of 2023, we received approximately 690 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 770 claims. We report claims as closed when we become aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when we have reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. Our total costs for the years 2022 and 2021 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately $57 million and $63 million, respectively. Our costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.

Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of pending claims against us are non-cancer claims. It is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may impact the estimate of our asbestos liabilities, including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims. We record an accrual for a loss

contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Our liability estimate is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, as well as consultation with a third party firm on trends that may impact our future asbestos liability. While we believe that our accrual for matters related to our predecessor operations, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods, and as a result our actual liabilities may be higher or lower than our accrual.

Other 
From time to time, we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that we are or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to our historical and predecessor operations. In addition, from time to time we receive personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from our historical operations and predecessors.

(a) Severance costs include the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation.
Following our 2022 operating segment realignment and as we integrated Showtime into Paramount+, we implemented further initiatives to streamline and transform our operations, and as a result recorded restructuring charges of $54 million for associated severance costs during the second quarter of 2023.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded restructuring charges of $85 million and $113 million, respectively, which were comprised of severance costs and the impairment of lease assets in each period. The severance costs were primarily associated with management changes following the operating segment realignment noted above. The lease impairments related to lease assets that we ceased use of with the intent to sublease in connection with initiatives to reduce our real estate footprint in New York City.

At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our restructuring liability was $214 million and $302 million, respectively, and was recorded in “Other current liabilities” and “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we made payments for restructuring of $118 million. The restructuring liability at September 30, 2023, which principally relates to severance payments, is expected to be substantially paid by the end of 2024.

In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a benefit of $10 million in other corporate matters for an insurance recovery related to litigation described under Legal Matters—Stockholder Matters in Note 13.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded charges for other corporate matters of $84 million and $163 million, respectively, of which $77 million and $117 million, respectively, were associated with litigation described under Legal Matters—Stockholder Matters in Note 13. Also included in other corporate matters were charges of $7 million and $46 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, recorded following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, principally to reserve against amounts due from counterparties in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.

See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” for details of these items and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).
For the three months ended September 30, 2023, revenues increased 3% to $7.13 billion, reflecting revenue growth from our streaming services, led by Paramount+. The growth was partially offset by lower revenue from our linear networks, mainly resulting from weakness in the global advertising market.

Operating income increased 10% to $621 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The operating income comparison was impacted by $169 million of charges for restructuring and other corporate matters in 2022. Adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted OIBDA”), which excludes these charges as well as other items described under Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures, decreased 9% as the increase in revenues was more than offset by higher costs, primarily associated with the distribution of our films and streaming services.

For the three months ended September 30, 2023, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Paramount increased $94 million to $247 million and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) from continuing operations increased $.15 to $.36 compared with the prior-year period. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Paramount and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, which exclude the items impacting the comparability of operating income as well as other items described under Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures, decreased $63 million and $.09 per diluted share, respectively. These declines reflect the lower Adjusted OIBDA and a higher loss from our equity-method investments.

Labor Strikes
In May 2023, the Writers Guild of America (“WGA”) commenced an industry-wide strike following the expiration of its collective bargaining agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (“AMPTP”). In July 2023, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (“SAG-AFTRA”) also commenced an industry-wide strike after the expiration of its collective bargaining agreement with the AMPTP.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
These strikes resulted in temporary shutdowns of production on certain of our television and film programming. The WGA strike has ended; however, the SAG-AFTRA strike is ongoing and as a result the timing of resuming production and the impact on our future results and cash flows remains uncertain.

(a) Certain items identified as affecting comparability are excluded in non-GAAP results. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” for details of these items and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, revenues decreased slightly to $22.01 billion, as growth in revenues from our streaming services, led by Paramount+, was offset by lower revenues from our theatrical releases, linear networks, and content licensing. The decline for our linear networks principally reflects weakness in the global advertising market.

We reported an operating loss of $855 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared with operating income of $2.16 billion for the comparable prior-year period. The comparison was impacted by programming charges of $2.37 billion recorded in 2023. Adjusted OIBDA, which excludes these charges, as well as other items described under Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures, decreased 30%, driven by the decline in linear revenues and the timing and mix of theatrical releases in each year, partially offset by improved results for our streaming services.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we reported a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Paramount of $1.29 billion, or $2.04 per diluted share, compared with net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Paramount of $902 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, for the same prior-year period. The comparison was impacted by the programming charges noted above and the other items described under Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures. These items have been excluded in adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Paramount and adjusted diluted EPS, which decreased $743 million and $1.15 per diluted share, respectively, primarily reflecting the lower tax-effected Adjusted OIBDA and losses from our investment in SkyShowtime.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures
Results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 included certain items identified as affecting comparability. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Paramount, and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations (together, the “adjusted measures”) exclude the impact of these items and are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We use these measures to, among other things, evaluate our operating performance. These measures are among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods, and they are important indicators of our operational strength and business performance. In addition, we use Adjusted OIBDA to, among other things, value prospective acquisitions. We believe these measures are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by our management; provide a clearer perspective on our underlying performance; and make it easier for investors, analysts and peers to compare our operating performance to other companies in our industry and to compare our year-over-year results.

Because the adjusted measures are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income (loss), earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, (provision for) benefit from income taxes, net earnings (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Paramount or diluted EPS from continuing operations, as applicable, as indicators of operating performance. These measures, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

The following tables reconcile the adjusted measures to their most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP.

Advertising
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, advertising revenues decreased 9% and 7%, respectively, driven by a decline in linear advertising reflecting continued weakness in the global advertising market, partially offset by higher advertising revenues for our streaming services. In addition, foreign exchange rate changes negatively impacted the total advertising revenue comparison by 2 percentage points and 1 percentage point for the three- and nine-month periods, respectively.

Affiliate and Subscription
Affiliate and subscription revenues are principally comprised of affiliate fees received from multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs), including virtual MVPDs (vMVPDs) which distribute their services via streaming, for carriage of our cable networks (cable affiliate fees) and owned television stations (retransmission fees), fees received from television stations for their affiliation with the CBS Television Network (reverse compensation), and subscription fees for our streaming services.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, affiliate and subscription revenues increased 14% and 13%, respectively, primarily driven by growth in subscribers for Paramount+ to 63.4 million at September 30, 2023 from 46.0 million at September 30, 2022, as well as higher revenues from pay-per-view boxing events. These increases were partially offset by lower affiliate fees for our linear networks.

Theatrical
For the three months ended September 30, 2023, theatrical revenues increased 63%, primarily reflecting the third quarter 2023 releases of Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. Theatrical revenues in the prior-year period were principally from the continued success of Top

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
Gun: Maverick, which was released in the second quarter of 2022. Theatrical revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 decreased 35%, reflecting the comparison against the strong performance of Top Gun: Maverick in the second and third quarters of 2022, partially offset by theatrical revenues from the previously mentioned third quarter 2023 releases.

Licensing and Other
Licensing and other revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of the rights to exhibit our internally-produced television and film programming on various platforms in the secondary market after its initial exhibition on our owned or third-party platforms; license fees from content produced or distributed for third parties; home entertainment revenues, which include the viewing of our content on a transactional basis through transactional video-on-demand (TVOD) and electronic sell-through services and the sale and distribution of our content through DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesale and retail partners; fees from the use of our trademarks and brands for consumer products, recreation and live events; and revenues from the rental of production facilities.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, licensing and other revenues decreased 8% and 3%, respectively, primarily reflecting lower revenues from content produced for third parties. Content available for licensing has been and may continue to be impacted by temporary production shutdowns as a result of labor strikes.

Content Costs
Content costs include the amortization of costs of internally-produced television and theatrical film content; amortization of acquired program rights; other television production costs, including on-air talent; and participation and residuals expenses, which reflect amounts owed to talent and other participants in our content pursuant to contractual and collective bargaining arrangements.

For the three months ended September 30, 2023, content costs increased 1%, primarily driven by increased investment in our streaming services, costs associated with pay-per-view boxing events and theatrical releases, partially offset by lower costs from the decline in licensing revenues. For the nine-month period, the 1% increase primarily reflects increased investment in our streaming services, partially offset by lower costs associated with theatrical releases and licensing revenues.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
Content costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, include $57 million of incremental costs incurred to retain our production capabilities for certain of the television and film productions that have been delayed as a result of the labor strikes. The magnitude of incremental costs during the fourth quarter of 2023 will depend on the duration of the SAG-AFTRA strike.

Distribution and Other
Distribution and other operating expenses primarily include costs relating to the distribution of our content, including print and advertising for theatrical releases and costs for third-party distribution; compensation; revenue-sharing costs to television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network; and other ancillary and overhead costs associated with our operations.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, distribution and other expenses increased 21% and 14%, respectively, primarily reflecting higher costs associated with theatrical releases and the growth of our streaming services, including costs for third-party distribution, revenue sharing, and compensation.

Programming Charges
During the first half of 2023, in connection with the integration of Showtime into Paramount+ across both streaming and linear platforms, we performed a comprehensive strategic review of the combined content portfolio of Showtime and Paramount+. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2023, we commenced a review of our international content portfolio in connection with initiatives to rationalize and right-size our international operations to align with our streaming strategy, and close or globalize certain of our international channels. As a result, we changed the strategy for certain content, which led to content being removed from our platforms or abandoned, the write-off of development costs, distribution changes, and termination of programming agreements. Accordingly, during the first half of 2023 we recorded programming charges on the Consolidated Statement of Operations relating to these actions. These charges, which totaled $2.37 billion, were comprised of $1.97 billion for the impairment of content to its estimated fair value, as well as $402 million for development cost write-offs and contract termination costs.

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include costs incurred for advertising, marketing, occupancy, professional service fees, and back office support, including employee compensation and technology. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, SG&A expenses increased 4% and 5%, respectively, driven by higher employee costs, including for incentive compensation and to support the growth of our streaming services. The increase for the three months was partially offset by lower advertising and marketing costs.

(a) Severance costs include the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation.
Following our 2022 operating segment realignment and as we integrated Showtime into Paramount+, we implemented further initiatives to streamline and transform our operations, and as a result recorded restructuring charges of $54 million for associated severance costs during the second quarter of 2023. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a benefit of $10 million in other corporate matters for an insurance recovery related to litigation described under Legal Matters—Stockholder Matters.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded restructuring charges of $85 million and $113 million, respectively, which were comprised of severance costs and the impairment of lease assets in each period. The severance costs were primarily associated with management changes following the operating segment realignment noted above. The lease impairments related to lease assets that we ceased use of with the intent to sublease in connection with initiatives to reduce our real estate footprint in New York City. Additionally, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded charges for other corporate matters of $84 million and $163 million, respectively, of which $77 million and $117 million, respectively, were associated with litigation described under Legal Matters—Stockholder Matters. Also included in other corporate matters were charges of $7 million and $46 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, recorded following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, principally to reserve against amounts due from counterparties in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.

For the three months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded a loss of $4 million on the sale of a 37.5% interest in The CW, which was principally comprised of transaction costs, and an impairment of an investment of $5 million.

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded losses on extinguishment of debt totaling $120 million associated with the early redemption of long-term debt of $2.91 billion.

Provision for/Benefit from Income Taxes
The provision for/benefit from income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign taxes on earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $40 million, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of $436 million, reflecting effective income tax rates of 10.6% and 30.4%, respectively. Included in the third quarter of 2023 is a net discrete tax benefit of $33 million, primarily reflecting the benefit from guidance issued during the quarter by the IRS that resulted in additional foreign taxes from 2022 being eligible for a foreign tax credit, and amounts realized in connection with the filing of our tax returns in certain international jurisdictions. These items, together with a tax provision of $3 million on other corporate matters, decreased our effective income tax rate by 8.5 percentage points. The tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of a tax benefit of $582 million on programming charges of $2.37 billion. This item, together with a net discrete tax benefit of $67 million, which principally includes the $33 million discrete tax benefit for the quarter discussed above and the resolution of an income tax matter in a foreign jurisdiction, as well as a net tax provision of $49 million on other items identified as affecting the comparability of our results during the period (which include a gain from an investment and restructuring charges and other corporate matters), increased our effective income tax rate by 10.2 percentage points.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $101 million and $264 million, reflecting effective income tax rates of 31.3% and 20.1%, respectively. Included in the provision for income taxes for the third quarter of 2022 is a net discrete tax provision of $9 million, which primarily reflects discrete tax provisions realized in connection with the filing of our tax returns in certain international jurisdictions and from the transfer of subsidiaries in connection with a reorganization of our international operations. These items, together with a net tax benefit of $29 million on other items identified as affecting the comparability of our results during the period (which include charges for restructuring and other corporate matters, and a gain on a disposition) increased our effective income tax rate by 5.0 percentage points. The tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 included a net discrete tax benefit of $72 million primarily resulting from the transfer of intangible assets between our subsidiaries in connection with a reorganization of our international operations. This item, together with a net tax benefit of $77 million on other items identified as affecting the comparability of our results during the nine-month period (which include charges for restructuring and other corporate matters, a loss on extinguishment of debt, and gains on dispositions) decreased our effective income tax rate by 4.8 percentage points.

For the three months ended September 30, 2023, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Paramount and diluted EPS from continuing operations increased $94 million and $.15, respectively, compared with the prior-year period. These increases were primarily the result of the increase in operating income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we reported a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Paramount of $1.29 billion, or $2.04 per diluted share, compared with net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Paramount of $902 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, for the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily driven by the decline in tax-effected operating income, including the impact from the programming charges discussed above, partially offset by the investment gain discussed above.

Paramount+ Premium plan. Effective July 6, 2023, Showtime OTT was no longer offered as a standalone subscription service for new subscribers.

•Filmed Entertainment—Our Filmed Entertainment segment consists of Paramount Pictures, Paramount Players, Paramount Animation, Nickelodeon Studio, Awesomeness and Miramax.

We present operating income excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and other corporate matters, programming charges and gain on dispositions, each where applicable (“Adjusted OIBDA”), as the primary measure of profit and loss for our operating segments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance for segment reporting since it is the primary method used by our management. Stock-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of profit and loss because it is set and approved by our Board of Directors in consultation with corporate executive management. Stock-based compensation is included as a component of our consolidated Adjusted OIBDA. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures for a reconciliation of total Adjusted OIBDA to operating income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
Advertising
The 14% decrease in advertising revenues was primarily the result of continued weakness in the global advertising market. Domestic advertising revenues declined 13% to $1.43 billion and international advertising revenues decreased 16% to $274 million. The domestic decline also reflects lower political advertising revenues as a result of U.S. midterm elections in 2022. Foreign exchange rate changes negatively impacted the total advertising revenue comparison by 2 percentage points.

Affiliate and Subscription
Affiliate and subscription revenues increased slightly for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Domestic affiliate and subscription revenues increased 1% to $1.90 billion as higher subscription revenues from pay-per-view boxing events were substantially offset by declines in affiliate fees. The decrease in domestic affiliate fees reflects subscriber declines, which were largely offset by contractual pricing increases. International affiliate and subscription revenues decreased 6% to $105 million, driven by a shift of revenue from our pay television services to our streaming services following the restructuring of certain affiliate agreements.

Licensing and Other

Revenues
For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, revenues decreased 6%, driven by lower advertising revenues, primarily due to weakness in the global advertising market.

Advertising
The 11% decrease in advertising revenues was primarily the result of weakness in the global advertising market. Domestic advertising revenues declined 10% to $5.08 billion and international advertising revenues decreased 19% to $826 million. The domestic decline also reflects lower political advertising revenues as a result of U.S. midterm elections in 2022. Foreign exchange rate changes negatively impacted the total advertising revenue comparison by 1 percentage point.

Affiliate and Subscription
Affiliate and subscription revenues decreased 1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Domestic affiliate and subscription revenues decreased slightly to $5.76 billion as declines in affiliate fees were offset by higher subscription revenues from pay-per-view boxing events. The decrease in domestic affiliate fees reflects subscriber declines, which were largely offset by contractual pricing increases. International affiliate and subscription revenues decreased 13% to $322 million, driven by a shift of revenue from our pay television services to our streaming services following the restructuring of certain affiliate agreements.

Licensing and Other
Licensing and other revenues decreased 3%, principally reflecting lower revenues from content produced for third parties. Content available for licensing has been and may continue to be impacted by temporary production shutdowns as a result of labor strikes.

Advertising
The 18% increase in advertising revenues was primarily driven by higher impressions for Paramount+ and growth from Pluto TV, including from international launches.

Subscription
The 46% increase in subscription revenues was primarily driven by growth in U.S and international Paramount+ subscribers, which grew 17.4 million, or 38%, compared to September 30, 2022. The revenue growth also includes the impact from domestic pricing increases for each of our subscription plans that went into effect when we launched the Paramount+ with Showtime plan on June 27, 2023, as well as revenues from pay-per-view boxing events.

During the quarter, global Paramount+ subscribers increased 2.7 million, or 4%, to 63.4 million, compared with 60.7 million at June 30, 2023. The growth reflects the addition of certain Showtime OTT subscribers to the Paramount+ with Showtime plan, as well as the benefit from the start of the NFL season and the premieres of Special Ops: Lioness and season six of The Chi. The increases were partially offset by a reduction of 1.3 million subscribers in Latin America after we restructured a distribution agreement.

Adjusted OIBDA
Adjusted OIBDA improved by $105 million, as the higher revenues more than offset higher costs to support growth in our streaming services, including content, distribution, advertising and employee costs.

Adjusted OIBDA
Adjusted OIBDA decreased $90 million, primarily from the timing and mix of theatrical releases in each year, incremental costs incurred during production shutdowns, as well as lower revenue from studio rentals and production services, which contributed approximately $20 million of the decline.
Fluctuations in results for the Filmed Entertainment segment may occur as a result of the timing of the recognition of distribution costs, including print and advertising, which are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film, while the revenues for the respective film are recognized as earned through the film’s theatrical exhibition and distribution to other platforms.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources and Uses of Cash
We project anticipated cash requirements for our operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows expected to be generated and available to meet these needs. Our operating needs include, among other items, expenditures for content for our broadcast and cable networks and streaming services, including television and film programming, sports rights, and talent contracts, as well as advertising and marketing costs to promote our content and platforms; payments for leases, interest, and income taxes; and pension funding obligations. While our planned spending in 2023 included continued increased investment in our streaming services, our spending for content will be lower than we initially anticipated due to temporary shutdowns of production on certain of our television and film programming as a result of labor strikes.

Our investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures; acquisitions; funding relating to new and existing investments, including SkyShowtime, our streaming joint venture with Comcast Corporation, under which both parent companies have committed to support initial operations over a multiyear period; discretionary share repurchases, dividends and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness. Our long-term debt obligations due over the next five years were $3.21 billion as of September 30, 2023. We routinely assess our capital structure and opportunistically enter into transactions to manage our outstanding debt maturities, which could result in a charge from the early extinguishment of debt. Beginning with the dividend declared in the second quarter of 2023, we reduced the quarterly cash dividend on our Class A and Class B Common Stock to $.05 per share (or $.20 annually).

Funding for both our short-term and long-term operating, investing and financing needs will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, which were $1.80 billion as of September 30, 2023, proceeds from noncore asset sales, including the October 2023 sale of Simon & Schuster, and our ability to refinance our debt. Any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to us, the borrowing capacity under our $3.50 billion Credit Facility described below is sufficient to satisfy short-term borrowing needs. In addition, if necessary, we can increase our liquidity position by reducing non-committed spending.

Our access to capital markets and the cost of any new borrowings can be impacted by factors outside our control, including economic and market conditions, as well as by ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to access capital markets on terms and conditions that will be favorable to us.

Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents	$	(1,081)			$	(2,884)				$	1,803 		
Operating Activities
Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was a net use of cash of $174 million compared to a net source of cash of $219 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in operating cash flow from continuing operations primarily reflects higher collections from theatrical releases in the prior-year period, mainly from Top Gun: Maverick, as well as higher payments for restructuring, merger-related costs, and transformation initiatives in the current-year period, partially offset by lower spending for content in 2023.
Payments for restructuring, merger-related costs and transformation initiatives included in operating cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were $288 million and $133 million, respectively. The increase in 2023 is primarily due to payments in the current-year period associated with litigation described under Legal Matters—Stockholder Matters. Since the merger of Viacom Inc. (“Viacom”) with and into CBS Corporation (“CBS”) (the “Merger”), we have invested in a number of transformation initiatives. Initially, these were undertaken to realize synergies related to the Merger. More recently, our transformation initiatives are related to future-state technology, including the unification and evolution of systems and platforms, and migration to the cloud. In addition, we are investing in future-state workspaces, including adapting our facilities to accommodate our hybrid and agile work model.
Cash flow provided by operating activities from discontinued operations reflects the operating activities of Simon & Schuster. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the increase in operating cash flow from discontinued operations reflects higher collections, driven by higher revenues, and the timing of inventory spending.

(a) At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the senior and junior subordinated debt balances included (i) a net unamortized discount of $427 million and $442 million, respectively, and (ii) unamortized deferred financing costs of $84 million and $89 million, respectively. The face value of our total debt was $16.18 billion and $16.38 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

In September 2023, we repaid our $139 million of 7.875% debentures upon maturity. In addition, on November 1, 2023, we repaid our $35 million of 7.125% senior notes upon maturity.

On November 2, 2023, we announced the commencement of cash tender offers for up to $1.0 billion combined aggregate purchase price of certain of our outstanding senior notes due between 2025 and 2028.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we redeemed $2.39 billion of senior notes, prior to maturity, for an aggregate redemption price of $2.49 billion. Also in 2022, we redeemed $520 million of 5.875% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 at par. These redemptions resulted in a total pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $120 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we also issued $1.00 billion of 6.375% junior subordinated debentures due 2062. The interest rate on these debentures will reset on March 30, 2027, and every five years thereafter to a fixed rate equal to the 5-year Treasury Rate (as defined pursuant to the terms of the debentures) plus a spread. These debentures can be called by us at par plus a make whole premium any time before March 30, 2027, or at par on March 30, 2027, or at any interest payment date thereafter.

Our 6.25% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 accrue interest at the stated fixed rate until February 28, 2027, on which date the rate will switch to a floating rate. These debentures can be called by us at par at any time after the expiration of the fixed-rate period.

The subordination, interest deferral option and extended term of our junior subordinated debentures provide significant credit protection measures for senior creditors and, as a result of these features, the debentures received a 50% equity credit by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and Fitch Ratings Inc., and a 25% equity credit by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.

Commercial Paper
At both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
Credit Facility
During the first quarter of 2023, we amended and extended our $3.50 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), which now matures in January 2027 (the “2023 Amendment”). The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper borrowings, if any. We may, at our option, also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at the time of each borrowing and are generally based on either the prime rate in the U.S. or an applicable benchmark rate plus a margin (based on our senior unsecured debt rating), depending on the type and tenor of the loans entered into. Under the 2023 Amendment, we replaced LIBOR as the benchmark rate for loans denominated in U.S. dollars with Term SOFR. The benchmark rate for loans denominated in euros, sterling and yen is based on EURIBOR, SONIA and TIBOR, respectively. The Credit Facility was also amended to include a provision that the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the amended credit agreement) of Paramount will be an event of default that would give the lenders the right to accelerate any outstanding loans and terminate their commitments. At September 30, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the availability under the Credit Facility was $3.50 billion.

The Credit Facility has one principal financial covenant which sets a maximum Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (“Leverage Ratio”) at the end of each quarter, which prior to the 2023 Amendment was 4.5x. Under the 2023 Amendment, the maximum Leverage Ratio was increased to 5.75x for each quarter through and including the quarter ending September 30, 2024, and will then decrease to 5.5x for the quarters ending December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, with decreases of 0.25x for each subsequent quarter until it reaches 4.5x for the quarter ending March 31, 2026. The Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of our Consolidated Indebtedness, net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at the end of a quarter, to our Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the amended credit agreement) for the trailing twelve-month period. Under the 2023 Amendment, the definition of the Leverage Ratio was also modified to set the maximum amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents that can be netted against Consolidated Indebtedness to $1.50 billion for quarters ending on or after September 30, 2024. In addition, under the 2023 Amendment, Simon & Schuster was treated as a continuing operation for the purposes of calculating Consolidated EBITDA until its disposition in October 2023. We met the covenant as of September 30, 2023.

Other Bank Borrowings
At September 30, 2023, we had no outstanding bank borrowings under Miramax’s $50 million credit facility, which matures in November 2024. This facility replaced the previous $300 million credit facility that matured in April 2023. At December 31, 2022, we had $55 million of bank borrowings under the previous facility with a weighted average interest rate of 7.09%.
Guarantees
Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds
At September 30, 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $174 million that were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as a $1.9 billion standby letter of credit facility, under which no letters of credit were issued. In accordance with the contractual requirements of one of our commitments, we expect that a $1.9 billion letter of credit will be issued in January 2024 under the standby letter of credit facility. The amount outstanding under the letter of credit will decrease throughout 2024 as we make payments under the related contractual commitment. Letters of credit and surety bonds are primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business under contractual requirements of certain of our commitments. The standby letter of credit facility, which matures in May 2026, is subject to the same principal financial covenant as the Credit Facility (see Capital Structure—Credit Facility).

CBS Television City
In connection with the sale of the CBS Television City property and sound stage operation (“CBS Television City”) in 2019, we guaranteed a specified level of cash flows to be generated by the business during the first five years following the completion of the sale. Included in “Other current liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2023 is a liability totaling $26 million, reflecting the present value of the remaining estimated amount payable under the guarantee obligation.

Lease Guarantees
We have certain indemnification obligations with respect to leases primarily associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players Inc. These lease commitments totaled $11 million at September 30, 2023, and are presented within “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of lease commitments varies over time depending on the expiration or termination of individual underlying leases, or the related indemnification obligation, and foreign exchange rates, among other things. We may also have exposure for certain other expenses related to the leases, such as property taxes and common area maintenance. We believe our accrual is sufficient to meet any future obligations based on our consideration of available financial information, the lessees’ historical performance in meeting their lease obligations and the underlying economic factors impacting the lessees’ business models.

Other
In the course of our business, we both provide and receive indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, we may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. We record a liability for our indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable and reasonably estimable.
Legal Matters
General
On an ongoing basis, we vigorously defend ourselves in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and respond to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, “Litigation”). Litigation may be brought against us without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the following matters are not likely, in the aggregate, to result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Stockholder Matters
Litigation Relating to the Merger
Beginning in February 2020, three purported CBS stockholders filed separate derivative and/or putative class action lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Chancery Court”). In March 2020, the Delaware Chancery Court consolidated the three lawsuits and appointed Bucks County Employees Retirement Fund and International Union of Operating Engineers of Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware as co-lead plaintiffs for the consolidated action captioned In re CBS Corporation Stockholder Class Action and Derivative Litigation (the “CBS Litigation”). In April 2020, the lead plaintiffs filed a Verified Consolidated Class Action and Derivative Complaint (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”) against Shari E. Redstone, National Amusements, Inc., Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Trust, additional members of the CBS Board of

Directors (including Candace K. Beinecke, Barbara M. Byrne, Gary L. Countryman, Linda M. Griego, Robert N. Klieger, Martha L. Minow, Susan Schuman, Frederick O. Terrell and Strauss Zelnick), former CBS President and Acting Chief Executive Officer Joseph Ianniello and the Company as nominal defendant. The Complaint alleged breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with the negotiation and approval of an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 13, 2019, between CBS and Viacom (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”). The Complaint also alleged waste and unjust enrichment in connection with certain aspects of Mr. Ianniello’s compensation awards. The Complaint sought unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. In December 2022, the Delaware Chancery Court dismissed the fiduciary duty claim against Mr. Klieger.
In May 2023, the parties to the CBS Litigation entered into a settlement agreement that provided for, among other things, the final dismissal of the CBS Litigation in exchange for a settlement payment to the Company in the amount of $167.5 million, less administrative costs and plaintiffs’ counsels’ fees and expenses. In September 2023, the Delaware Chancery Court approved the settlement and dismissed the CBS Litigation with prejudice. In October 2023, the Company received the settlement payment in the amount of $120 million, which reflects the settlement of $167.5 million after a deduction was made for administrative costs and plaintiffs’ counsels’ fees and expenses, and accordingly, we will recognize a gain of $120 million during the fourth quarter of 2023.

Beginning in November 2019, four purported Viacom stockholders filed separate putative class action lawsuits in the Delaware Chancery Court. In January 2020, the Delaware Chancery Court consolidated the four lawsuits. In February 2020, the Delaware Chancery Court appointed California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“CalPERS”) as lead plaintiff for the consolidated action. Subsequently, in February 2020, CalPERS, together with Park Employees’ and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago and Louis M. Wilen, filed a First Amended Verified Class Action Complaint (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”) against NAI, NAI Entertainment Holdings LLC, Shari E. Redstone, the members of the special transaction committee of the Viacom Board of Directors (comprised of Thomas J. May, Judith A. McHale, Ronald L. Nelson and Nicole Seligman) and our President and Chief Executive Officer and director, Robert M. Bakish (as used in this paragraph, the “Viacom Litigation”). The Complaint alleged breaches of fiduciary duties to Viacom stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Merger Agreement. The Complaint sought unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. In December 2020, the Delaware Chancery Court dismissed the claims against Mr. Bakish, while allowing the claims against the remaining defendants to proceed.

In March 2023, the parties to the Viacom Litigation entered into a settlement agreement that provided for, among other things, the final dismissal of the Viacom Litigation in exchange for a settlement payment in the amount of $122.5 million, which has been fully paid. In July 2023, the Delaware Chancery Court granted approval of the settlement and dismissed the Viacom Litigation with prejudice.

Litigation Related to Stock Offerings
In August 2021, Camelot Event Driven Fund filed a putative securities class action lawsuit in New York Supreme Court, County of New York, and in November 2021, an amended complaint was filed that, among other changes, added an additional named plaintiff (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”). The Complaint is purportedly on behalf of investors who purchased shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock and 5.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to public securities offerings completed in March 2021, and was filed against the Company, certain senior executives, members of our Board of Directors, and the underwriters involved in the offerings. The Complaint asserts violations of federal securities law and alleges that the offering documents contained material misstatements and omissions, including through an alleged failure to adequately disclose certain total return swap transactions involving Archegos Capital Management referenced to our securities and related alleged risks to the Company’s stock price. In December 2021, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation seeking the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the outside director defendants from the lawsuit, which the Court subsequently ordered. On the same date, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit, which were heard in

January 2023. In February 2023, the Court dismissed all claims against the Company while allowing the claims against the underwriters to proceed. The plaintiffs and underwriter defendants have appealed the ruling.

Litigation Related to Television Station Owners
In September 2019, the Company was added as a defendant in a multi-district putative class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The lawsuit was filed by parties that claim to have purchased broadcast television spot advertising beginning about January 2014 on television stations owned by one or more of the defendant television station owners and alleges the sharing of allegedly competitively sensitive information among such television stations in alleged violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The action, which names the Company among fourteen total defendants, seeks monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, costs and interest as well as injunctions against the allegedly unlawful conduct. We reached an agreement with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit. The settlement, which includes no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Company, is subject to Court approval. In August 2023, the Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement.

Claims Related to Former Businesses
Asbestos
We are a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. We are typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of our products is the basis of a claim. Claims against us in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines and electrical equipment.

Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. We do not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of September 30, 2023, we had pending approximately 20,670 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 21,580 as of December 31, 2022. During the third quarter of 2023, we received approximately 690 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 770 claims. We report claims as closed when we become aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when we have reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. Our total costs for the years 2022 and 2021 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately $57 million and $63 million, respectively. Our costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.

Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of pending claims against us are non-cancer claims. It is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may impact the estimate of our asbestos liabilities, including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be

reasonably estimated. Our liability estimate is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, as well as consultation with a third party firm on trends that may impact our future asbestos liability. While we believe that our accrual for matters related to our predecessor operations, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods, and as a result our actual liabilities may be higher or lower than our accrual.

Other 
From time to time, we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that we are or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to our historical and predecessor operations. In addition, from time to time we receive personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from our historical operations and predecessors.
