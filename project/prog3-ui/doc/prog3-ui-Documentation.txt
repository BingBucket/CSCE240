The prog3-ui.cpp file is the main cpp file for the program, and is what should be ran.
Run from within the prog3-ui folder, and not any folder above that directory.
Ensure that part.cpp is linked with the correct header file, and that the prog3-ui.cpp file takes it in.

Please ensure that both company name and the section you want to search for are all in one query.
This program does not ask for specifications if you do not input in a company name. It will instead just either take the company from the previous query, or it will take from the Netflix 10k file.
The program is able to output information for each company for the following:
- All parts (Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4, and all parts combined)
    - To get all parts, simply input "tell me everything" or "give all information".
- Business information, risk factors, properties, market information, and legal statements from part 1.
- Disclosures from part 2.
- Directors and compensation from part 3.
- Financial statements from part 4.
