The session can be switched to query statistics by inputting "show chat session". The program will first ask for confirmation before switching to the statistics session.
The program ends after either the statistics session ends or the general chat session ends.
In the statistics session, the available commands are "summary", "statistics", "show chat session", and "showchat" followed by the row number.
summary shows the total statistics of all sessions, statistics shows the statistic of a specific given session, and both showchat and show chat session gives the recorded chat data given the row number.
