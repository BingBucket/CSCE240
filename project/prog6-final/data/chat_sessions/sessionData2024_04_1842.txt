Here is the business information. I have written everything from business to the output file.

ABOUT US
Netflix, Inc. (“Netflix”, “the Company”, “registrant”, “we”, or “us”) is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with over 260 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.
Our core strategy is to grow our business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We strive to continuously improve our members' experience by offering compelling content that delights them and attracts new members. We seek to drive conversation around our content to further enhance member joy, and we are continuously enhancing our user interface to help our members more easily choose content that they will find enjoyable.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS
We operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.

COMPETITION
The market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete with a broad set of activities for consumers’ leisure time, including other entertainment video providers, such as linear TV, streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment, like social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against entertainment video providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.
While consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of "winning moments of truth." In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we seek to continually improve our service, including both our technology and our content offerings.
SEASONALITY
Our membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing. Historically, the fourth quarter represents our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membership growth can be impacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing and plans.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our service. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.
REGULATION
The media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix. This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the extent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.
HUMAN CAPITAL
We view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 13,000 full-time employees. Of these, approximately 9,000 (69%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,000 (15%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 500 (4%) in Latin America and 1,500 (12%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year. We believe a critical component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a "Culture Memo" located on our website, is often described as providing a unique environment for our associates to perform the best work of their lives in pursuit of excellence. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. We empower all of our employees so that they can have significant impact and input into decision-making; each employee has a high degree of freedom and power to make the decisions and take actions in the best interest of the company in carrying out their role. In return, our employees are responsible and accountable for those decisions and actions. With this approach, we believe we are a more flexible, fun, stimulating, creative, collaborative and successful organization.
As we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We are mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We work to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it’s important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve. We look to help increase representation by training our recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. We publish annually an update on our inclusion initiatives and progress, which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and publish our EEO-1 reports on our website.
We believe in fostering great leaders. We offer programs, such as seminars and lectures, that are designed to equip our leaders (officers, VPs, people managers and director and senior manager-level employees) to lead the business and our teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic goals. We have built a portfolio of programs under three foundational pillars - great company, great leaders, and great human beings - which we believe support our current and future success. We also offer programs and workshops to provide skills and coaching to employees on a variety of topics, such as leading and inspiring
teams. We believe this focus helps our employees grow as leaders and well-rounded individuals, and better positions Netflix to operate our global business of providing compelling content to entertain the world.
We aim to generally pay our employees at the top of their personal market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee's individual needs and preferences. We conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender (globally) and race (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.
We care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health benefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations.
We believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.

Business.
Overview
We are a leading global media, streaming and entertainment company that creates premium content and experiences for audiences worldwide. Driven by iconic consumer brands, our portfolio includes CBS, Showtime Networks, Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, BET, Paramount+ and Pluto TV. We hold one of the industry’s most extensive libraries of television and film titles. In addition to offering innovative streaming services and digital video products, we also provide powerful capabilities in production, distribution and advertising solutions.
Our strategy is grounded in three key strengths: (1) our broad range of popular content; (2) our multiplatform distribution model; and (3) our global operating reach. In 2022, we demonstrated the continued breadth and depth of our content capabilities across our distribution platforms — broadcast, including the leading network in the United States (the “U.S.”), CBS; a portfolio of cable networks that includes Nickelodeon, MTV and BET; a rapidly growing subscription streaming service, Paramount+; a leading free advertising-supported streaming television (“FAST”) service in the U.S., Pluto TV; and an iconic Hollywood studio, Paramount Pictures. Our global operating footprint includes content production capabilities across Latin America, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”), Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific, cable networks in many key markets and deep commercial relationships with strategic partners around the world.
2022 was a notable year for us in streaming. Benefiting from a slate of original series, including Halo, 1883, 1923, Tulsa King, Criminal Minds: Evolution and SEAL Team, and original films, including Orphan: First Kill and Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe, our global streaming subscribers grew 38% year-over-year to 77.3 million and Paramount+ subscribers grew 70% year-over-year to 55.9 million. According to Antenna, Paramount+ is the number one premium streaming service in domestic sign-ups and gross subscriber additions since its launch in March 2021 through the end of 2022, and had the most sign-ups in 2022. In sports, we reached a six-year multiplatform U.S. media rights extension for the Union of European Football Associations (“UEFA”) Champions League. We also recently announced that we will be fully integrating SHOWTIME into Paramount+
                                                
across both streaming and linear platforms later in 2023. In free, Pluto TV global monthly active users (MAUs) increased 22% year-over-year to 78.5 million.
Paramount Pictures released six films in 2022 that debuted at number one at the domestic box office — Scream, Jackass Forever, The Lost City, Sonic The Hedgehog 2, Top Gun: Maverick and Smile. These hits were led by Top Gun: Maverick, the fifth highest-grossing domestic movie of all time and first film to top the domestic box office on both Memorial Day and Labor Day. Following its theatrical run, the film has continued to draw big audiences in the U.S. digital home entertainment market and on Paramount+. Released in the fall, Smile became the highest-grossing horror film of the year worldwide.
CBS finished the 2021-2022 season as America’s number one broadcast network in primetime for the 14th consecutive season. In entertainment, CBS was number one across multiple genres — drama (NCIS); new comedy (Ghosts); primetime news series (60 Minutes); late night series (The Late Show with Stephen Colbert); and the number one daytime lineup for the 35th consecutive year. CBS Sports delivered its most-watched National Football League (the “NFL”) regular season in seven years, while Paramount+ had its most-streamed NFL regular season ever, recording double-digit year-over-year growth. Additionally, for the 14th consecutive year, CBS Sports maintained college football’s highest average viewership. Beginning next season, we will air Big Ten football and basketball games as part of a multiplatform agreement that extends through the end of the decade.
Our portfolio of cable networks attracted audiences through a broad range of shows, including the most watched original series in the U.S. across all of television, Yellowstone, and one of the world’s most popular preschool series, PAW Patrol. In 2022, adult cable series on our cable networks accounted for three of the top five and five of the top ten series among adults 18 to 34. Nickelodeon networks accounted for seven of the top ten cable series among kids two to 11 and returned to share growth for the first time in five years.
In 2022, we focused on expanding our global footprint and building key distribution partnerships with industry leaders including Sky, CANAL+ and Virgin Media. We launched Paramount+ in South Korea, the U.K., Ireland, Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland and Austria, and in the U.S., launched a first-of-its-kind partnership with Walmart to offer Paramount+ Essential to Walmart+ members. SkyShowtime, our streaming joint venture with Comcast, launched in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden (the “Nordics”). Finally, we launched Pluto TV in Canada with Corus and in the Nordics with Viaplay Group.
We continued our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) in 2022. We hosted our fourth annual Global Inclusion Week, a week-long initiative featuring conversations, panels and workshops designed to ensure our workforce and culture reflect, celebrate and elevate the diversity of our audiences and communities. We also continued to advance Content for Change, a companywide initiative designed to use the power of our content, creative supply chain and culture to counteract bias, stereotypes and hate. We released our third Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Report, and made progress on our ESG strategy and goals across our three focus areas: (1) On-Screen Content & Social Impact, (2) Workforce & Culture and (3) Sustainable Production & Operations. We also hosted our 26th annual Community Day, a global day of community service focused on causes and issues that resonate with our employees and audiences.

Competition
We operate in highly competitive environments and compete for creative talent and intellectual property, as well as for audiences and distribution of our content.
We compete with a variety of media, technology and entertainment companies with substantial resources to produce, acquire and distribute content around the world, including broadcast and cable networks, streaming services, film and television studios, production groups, independent producers and syndicators, television stations and television station groups. We compete with other content creators for creative talent, including producers, directors, actors and writers, as well as for new content ideas and intellectual property and for the acquisition of popular programming.
We compete for audiences for our content with releases from other film studios, television producers and streaming services, as well as with other forms of entertainment and consumer spending outlets. We compete for audiences and advertising revenues primarily with other television networks; streaming services; social media; websites, apps and other online experiences; radio programming; and print media. Our businesses also face competition from the many other entertainment options available to consumers, including video games, sports, travel and outdoor recreation.
We face competition for distribution of our content. Our TV Media businesses compete for distribution of our program services (and receipt of related fees) with other television networks and programmers. We also compete with other broadcast networks to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations to ensure the effective distribution of network programming in the U.S. We also compete with studios and other producers of entertainment content for distribution on third-party platforms.
For additional information regarding competition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry — We operate in highly competitive industries.”
                                                
Environmental, Social and Governance Strategy
Our ESG strategy is centered on understanding and responding to our biggest risks and opportunities. We organize our ESG work into three focus areas: (1) On-Screen Content & Social Impact, (2) Workforce & Culture and (3) Sustainable Production & Operations. On-Screen Content & Social Impact encompasses the opportunities and responsibilities we have to represent, inform and influence through our content and brands. Workforce & Culture includes our efforts to recruit and retain the best employees; treat employees, contractors and partners well; and foster an environment where everyone feels welcome and safe. Sustainable Production & Operations aims to address the environmental and social impacts of our operations and facilities. In 2022, we released our third ESG Report, which is available on our website and includes an update on the progress we have made in each focus area.
ESG Governance
Our ESG team oversees the day-to-day strategy and implementation of our ESG efforts under the leadership of a steering committee, comprised of senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel. We also have multiple working groups dedicated to specific ESG topics made up of subject matter experts from across our brands and functional teams, which together with the steering committee constitute our ESG Council. Our ESG Council actively reviews and refines our ESG strategies and the ESG team regularly updates senior management, our Board of Directors and its Nominating and Governance Committee, which, pursuant to its charter, oversees and monitors significant issues impacting our culture and reputation, as well as our handling of ESG matters.
Human Capital Management
We work to create a culture that is welcoming and nurturing to all, and a workplace where our employees and talent feel supported, heard and understood, and have the opportunity to thrive. Our human capital management strategy is intended to address the areas described below, and additional information can be found in our ESG Report.
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 24,500 full- and part-time employees in 37 countries worldwide and had approximately 5,800 project-based staff on our payroll. We also use temporary employees in the ordinary course of business.
A Culture of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We continue to cultivate a culture that reflects to our core values and is rooted in our dynamic and proactive approach to DEI through a range of partnerships, collaborations, programs and initiatives.
•Senior leaders from across the Company serve on a cross-functional council focused on inclusion, and many of our brands and functional teams maintain internal inclusivity councils to address DEI activities and challenges, including workforce pipeline development, external DEI-focused partnerships, and sponsorship and mentoring initiatives targeting underrepresented groups.
•We partner with diversity-focused institutions and professional associations both domestically and internationally that are committed to supporting, and post positions to diversity-centric job boards with organizations that support, women, BIPOC and LGBTQ+ individuals, military personnel and veterans and/or persons with disabilities to help attract, engage and retain diverse talent at all levels.
•We introduced a dedicated talent sourcing team focused on building diverse talent pipelines. We sponsor internal and external professional development programs and campus-to-career initiatives aimed at underrepresented groups.
                                                
•We also host an annual Global Inclusion Week, a companywide initiative featuring curated sessions designed to spark thoughtful dialogue on diversity, inclusion and belonging.
•We sponsor employee resource groups with chapters in locations worldwide.
•Our Chief Executive Officer is a signatory of the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion pledge and we are a founding signatory for the Management Leadership for Tomorrow’s Black Equity at Work Certification Program.
Preventing Harassment and Discrimination
We remain committed to building a work environment free of harassment and discrimination and have taken significant actions as part of this commitment.
•Our Global Business Conduct Statement guides our approach to preventing harassment, discrimination, and any other behavior that creates a hostile workplace. It provides employees with clear examples of harassment and discrimination and guidance on how to create a safe and inclusive environment for all employees. We make annual trainings on sexual harassment, discrimination, and retaliation prevention available to all employees, as well as unconscious bias training and inclusive recruitment training for hiring managers.
•We require that employees report any incidents of harassment and discrimination and provide multiple reporting options, including an anonymous third-party-managed complaint and reporting hotline.
•Our centralized Employee Relations team oversees all investigations of complaints of discrimination, harassment and retaliation in all areas of the organization, including our own productions.
•We monitor employee diversity data trends by gender, ethnicity, and level, as well as self-reported metrics such as sexual orientation and disability inclusion, including to track the promotion rates of women and ethnically diverse employees and identify and address any patterns that might suggest discrimination or unconscious bias.
Employee Attraction, Retention and Training
We strive to create a high-performance culture, including investing in building outstanding managers and teams, strengthening employee development, and helping every team member live up to that team member’s full potential. Our training, mentoring and career mobility programs embody our culture of DEI as we recruit, retain and engage our employees.
•We offer a diverse and flexible range of learning opportunities for our employees, including expanded skill-building offerings, weekly courses for managers, multi-month leadership cohort experiences and customized team workshops.
•We provide tuition support programs for employees pursuing education and encourage employees to learn, develop and collaborate through mentoring programs.
•We offer comprehensive compensation and benefits, including health, life and disability insurance; matching retirement contributions; flexible paid time off; paid volunteer time; financial planning assistance; multiple wellness programs; bicycle commuter reimbursement; and parental, caregiving, bereavement and military leave benefits. In addition, we support families with a range of resources, including enhanced fertility, adoption and surrogacy benefits, along with childcare and eldercare resources, and flexible work hours.
•In 2022, we launched our second global employee engagement survey to assess our efforts around employee engagement, inclusion and well-being. Senior leaders reviewed the survey results and instituted action plans to address feedback and opportunity areas.
                                                
Health, Safety and Security
The physical and mental well-being of our workers, including across our productions worldwide, remains a top priority. We strive to take a proactive and targeted approach to identifying and mitigating health, safety and security risks.
•Our cross-functional return-to-office task force created and executed a hybrid work plan focused on collaboration and flexibility. We also established new health offerings for certain locations to facilitate the transition, including the return of our Wellness Studio, offering exercise and training options.
•Production team members are required to attend daily safety meetings that serve as an overview of potential on-set safety hazards that day. We also require job- and event-specific safety training for employees where relevant.
•We strive to track and report safety, health and security incident data across the Company, implementing process changes and training as relevant.
•Our global security command center oversees security and emergency response efforts and undertakes risk scans to identify potential safety threats.
•We offer confidential mental health resources to support our employees and their families year-round and accessible mental health care and meditation programs to facilitate employee self-care.
Social Impact and Corporate Social Responsibility
We use our content and platforms to represent, explore and champion issues that align with our values and impact our viewers, including by exploring and raising awareness of issues such as social justice, climate change, mental health, and civic engagement. We drive our social impact through our content and with our partners in communities globally. Our commitment to social impact is not only exemplified by the content we produce, but also our community service projects, philanthropy and employee engagement efforts.
Content for Change
Content for Change, first launched by BET and then rolled out across the Company, is an initiative to use the power of storytelling to transform how we see ourselves and one another, and to counteract bias, stereotypes and hate in our society. The initiative is grounded in data-driven research in partnership with the University of Southern California’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative and centered across three pillars — the content we produce, the creative supply chain that powers it and our culture.
SpongeBob SquarePants: Operation Sea Change
In 2022, we launched SpongeBob SquarePants: Operation Sea Change, a multi-year global ocean conservation and sustainability initiative. Through partnerships with several non-profit organizations, Operation Sea Change aims to help remove and divert ocean plastic by funding global clean-up work, promoting sustainable products, and educating fans on how they can help protect the ocean.
Regulation
Our businesses and the intellectual property they create or acquire are subject to and affected by laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state and local governmental authorities, as well as laws and regulations of countries other than the U.S. and pan-national bodies such as the European Union (“E.U.”). The laws and regulations affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change, as are the protections that those laws and regulations afford us. The discussion below describes certain, but not all, laws and regulations affecting our businesses.
                                                
FCC and Similar Regulation
The FCC regulates broadcast television, some aspects of cable network programming, and certain programming delivered by internet protocol in the U.S., pursuant to U.S. federal law, including the Communications Act. Violation of FCC regulations can result in substantial monetary fines, the imposition of reporting obligations, limited renewals of broadcast station licenses and, in egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of a license.
License Renewals and Transfers
Each of our owned television stations in the U.S. must be licensed by the FCC. Television broadcast licenses are typically granted for eight-year terms, and we must obtain renewals as they expire to continue operating our stations. The Communications Act requires the FCC to renew a broadcast license if the FCC finds that (1) the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; (2) with respect to the station, there have been no serious violations by the licensee of either the Communications Act or FCC regulations; and (3) there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC regulations that, taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse. A station remains authorized to operate while its license renewal application is pending. In addition, the Communications Act requires prior FCC approval for the assignment of a license or transfer of control of an FCC licensee.
Broadcast Ownership Regulation
The Communications Act and FCC rules impose limits on local and national broadcast television station ownership in the U.S. The broadcast ownership rules discussed below are the most relevant to our U.S. operations.
Local Television Ownership
The FCC’s local television ownership rule generally prohibits common ownership of two full-power stations in a market unless at least one of the stations is not a top-four ranked station in the market based on audience share at the time of acquisition of the second station. However, the FCC may permit such common ownership if it finds such ownership would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity.
Dual Network Rule
The dual network rule prohibits any of the four major U.S. broadcast networks — ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC — from combining or being under common control.
Television National Audience Reach Limitation
Under the national television ownership rule, one party may not own television stations that reach more than 39% of all U.S. television households. For purposes of this rule, a UHF station is afforded a “discount” and is therefore attributed with reaching only 50% of the television households in its market. We currently own and operate television stations that reach approximately 38% of all U.S. television households, but we are attributed with reaching approximately 24% of all such households for purposes of the national ownership rule because of the discount.
Foreign Ownership
The Communications Act generally restricts foreign individuals or entities from collectively owning more than 25% of our voting power or equity. FCC approval is required to exceed the 25% threshold. The FCC has approved foreign ownership levels of up to 100% in certain instances, following its review and approval of specific, named foreign individuals.
                                                
Cable and Satellite Carriage of Television Broadcast Stations
The Communications Act and FCC rules govern the retransmission of broadcast television stations by cable system operators, direct broadcast satellite operators, and other MVPDs in the U.S. Pursuant to these regulations, we have elected to negotiate with MVPDs for the right to carry our broadcast television stations via retransmission consent agreements. The Communications Act and FCC regulations require that broadcasters and some categories of MVPDs negotiate in good faith for retransmission consent. Some MVPDs have sought changes to federal law that would eliminate or otherwise limit the ability of broadcasters to obtain fair compensation for the grant of retransmission consent.
Program Regulation
The FCC also regulates the content of broadcast, cable network, and other video programming. The FCC prohibits broadcasters from airing obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. The FCC’s maximum forfeiture penalty per station for broadcasting indecent or profane programming is $479,945 per indecent or profane utterance or image, with a maximum forfeiture exposure of approximately $4.3 million for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act. The FCC also monitors compliance with requirements that apply to broadcasters and cable networks relating to political advertising, identification of program sponsors, and the use and integrity of the Emergency Alert System. In addition, FCC regulations require the closed captioning of almost all broadcast and cable programming, as well as certain programming in the U.S. delivered by internet protocol. Broadcast television stations in certain markets that are affiliated with one of the four major U.S. broadcast networks must also provide a certain amount of programming every quarter that includes audio-narrated description of a program’s key visual elements that make the program accessible to blind and low-vision viewers.
Children’s Programming
Our business is subject to various regulations in the U.S. and abroad applicable to children’s programming. U.S. federal law and FCC rules limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown on broadcast television stations and cable networks during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger, and the FCC also limits the display of certain commercial website addresses during children’s programming. Moreover, each of our broadcast television stations in the U.S. is required to air, in general, three hours per week of programming specifically designed to meet the educational and informational programming needs of children 16 years of age and younger. In addition, some policymakers have sought limitations on food and beverage marketing in media popular with children and teens. For example, restrictions on the television advertising of foods high in fat, salt and sugar (“HFSS”) to children aged 15 and under have been in place in the U.K. since 2007. The U.K. government has announced its intention to impose a ban, effective in October 2025, on all HFSS advertising before 9:00 p.m. on television and a total ban online. Various laws with similar objectives have also been enacted in a number of jurisdictions, and pressure for their introduction elsewhere continues to be felt globally.
Broadcast Transmission Standard
FCC rules permit television broadcasters to voluntarily broadcast using the “Next Generation” broadcast television transmission standard developed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee, Inc., also called “ATSC 3.0.” Full-service television stations using the standard are subject to certain requirements, including the obligation to continue broadcasting a generally identical program stream in the current ATSC 1.0 broadcast standard. The ATSC 3.0 standard can be used to offer better picture quality and improved mobile broadcast viewing. A television station converting to ATSC 3.0 operation will incur significant costs in equipment purchases and upgrades. In addition, consumers may be required to obtain new television sets or other equipment that are capable of receiving ATSC 3.0 broadcasts. We are participating in ATSC 3.0 partnerships with other broadcasters and may enter into additional partnerships in the future.
                                                
International Free-to-Air Regulations
Our international free-to-air networks are subject to the rules and regulations of a number of foreign regulators, including the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in Australia; the Office of Communications (Ofcom) in the U.K.; Ente Nacional de Comunicaciones (ENACOM) in Argentina; and the Consejo Nacional de Televisión (CNTV) in Chile.
Global Data Protection Laws and Children’s Privacy Laws
We are subject to a number of data protection and privacy laws in many of the jurisdictions in which operate, including laws in a number of different U.S. states and the European Union. These laws impact, or may impact, the way we collect, process and transfer personal data. We are also subject to laws and regulations in many jurisdictions that are specifically intended to protect the interests of children, including the privacy of minors online. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Business Continuity, Cybersecurity and Privacy and Data Protection — We are subject to complex, often inconsistent and potentially costly laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and contractual obligations relating to privacy and personal data protection.”
Intellectual Property
We are fundamentally a content company, and the trademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property laws that protect our brands and content are extremely important to us. It is our practice to protect our brands, content and related intellectual property. Notwithstanding these efforts and the many legal protections that exist to combat piracy, the infringement of our intellectual property rights presents a significant challenge to our industry. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Intellectual Property — Infringement of our content reduces revenue received from the distribution of our programming, films, books, interactive games and other entertainment content.”

What would you like to know?
show netflix business
Here is the business information. I have written everything from business to the output file.

ABOUT US
Netflix, Inc. (“Netflix”, “the Company”, “registrant”, “we”, or “us”) is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with over 260 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.
Our core strategy is to grow our business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We strive to continuously improve our members' experience by offering compelling content that delights them and attracts new members. We seek to drive conversation around our content to further enhance member joy, and we are continuously enhancing our user interface to help our members more easily choose content that they will find enjoyable.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS
We operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.

COMPETITION
The market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete with a broad set of activities for consumers’ leisure time, including other entertainment video providers, such as linear TV, streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment, like social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against entertainment video providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.
While consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of "winning moments of truth." In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we seek to continually improve our service, including both our technology and our content offerings.
SEASONALITY
Our membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing. Historically, the fourth quarter represents our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membership growth can be impacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing and plans.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our service. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.
REGULATION
The media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix. This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the extent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.
HUMAN CAPITAL
We view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 13,000 full-time employees. Of these, approximately 9,000 (69%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,000 (15%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 500 (4%) in Latin America and 1,500 (12%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year. We believe a critical component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a "Culture Memo" located on our website, is often described as providing a unique environment for our associates to perform the best work of their lives in pursuit of excellence. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. We empower all of our employees so that they can have significant impact and input into decision-making; each employee has a high degree of freedom and power to make the decisions and take actions in the best interest of the company in carrying out their role. In return, our employees are responsible and accountable for those decisions and actions. With this approach, we believe we are a more flexible, fun, stimulating, creative, collaborative and successful organization.
As we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We are mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We work to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it’s important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve. We look to help increase representation by training our recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. We publish annually an update on our inclusion initiatives and progress, which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and publish our EEO-1 reports on our website.
We believe in fostering great leaders. We offer programs, such as seminars and lectures, that are designed to equip our leaders (officers, VPs, people managers and director and senior manager-level employees) to lead the business and our teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic goals. We have built a portfolio of programs under three foundational pillars - great company, great leaders, and great human beings - which we believe support our current and future success. We also offer programs and workshops to provide skills and coaching to employees on a variety of topics, such as leading and inspiring
teams. We believe this focus helps our employees grow as leaders and well-rounded individuals, and better positions Netflix to operate our global business of providing compelling content to entertain the world.
We aim to generally pay our employees at the top of their personal market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee's individual needs and preferences. We conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender (globally) and race (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.
We care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health benefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations.
We believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.
