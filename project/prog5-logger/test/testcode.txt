The main code to test is the prog5-sessionlogger.cpp in the src folder. This has a program that is prompted by user input and displays corresponding actions available.
There are only 2 chat sessions to read in this file, and the corresponding number inputted by the user will lead to different interactions.
An example of reading specific chat session statistics, as well as the overall summary of the chat sessions can be found in reportstatisticstest.png.
The only test not fully shown is showing the chat logs for the sessions, as they are very long. A snippet of the end of the terminal output can be seen in readfiletest.png
