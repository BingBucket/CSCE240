Like the previous program 3, this only works if you run the program within the prog4-userintent2querymapper directory.

The biggest change in this program is the addition of Query.h, Query.cpp, and their related methods. These methods are mainly used for determining the company's file to use.
The program should be able to handle similar queries to the previous program, but also checks how many times "paramount" or "netflix" appear in the user's query, and chooses a file based on the bigger frequency.
